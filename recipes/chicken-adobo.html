        <!-- Ordered list of Notes about the ingredients to be used for preparing and cooking the dish -->

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Chicken: </strong>slice the chicken into serving pieces before cooking. The cuts are usually smaller. 
            For example, a regular piece of chicken breast can be divided into 2 to 3 pieces depending on your preference.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Bay leaves: </strong>This is an essential ingredient for Filipino adobo. Dried bay leaves which is locally called "Dahon ng Laurel" are usually used becaused of its availabalibity year round. It can also be stored longer in room temperature.
            However, fresh bay leaves can also be utilized for this recipe.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Soy sauce: </strong>It is preferred to use Filipino brand soy sauce in making adobo as the dish will taste more authentic if local soy sauce is used. <em>Note: It is still possible to use foreign brand of soy sauce if a Filipino brand soy sauce is not available.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Vinegar: </strong>White vinegar is the most common type to use for adobo to prolong the lifespan of the dish once cooked and add more Filipino taste. Cane or rice vinegar can also be an alternative ingredient.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Garlic: </strong>Adobo should be garlicy. The garlic can be sauteed and boiled just like in this recipe, or it can be toasted. Toast by browning the crushed garlic in oil before adding the chicken. It is also possible to have an extra toasted garlic to have more for garnish later on.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>This is an optional ingredient. Sugar is added to balance the saltiness of the dish. It is possible to add more sugar if the chicken adobo is needed to be sweeten.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Salt: </strong>Also optional, as soy sauce is salty to begin with. Only add salt if needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Peppercorn: </strong>It does not matter if whole, crushed, or grounded. Whole peppercorn has just been used traditionally as it adds flavor to every dished around the world.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
