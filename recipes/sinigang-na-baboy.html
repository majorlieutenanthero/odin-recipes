        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>What's not to love about the Filipino pork soup with taro cooked in a sour broth of the Philippines which is called <strong><em>Sinigang na baboy with Gabi! </em></strong>The Sinigang can be the comfort food of some of our fellow Filipinos, and one of the first few dished that can bring back memories way back for some of us.</p>
        <p>The most important thing to consider in making sinigang dishes is the level of sourness of the soup! And that's a thing to remember!</p>
